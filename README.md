Contains:

1. 2012 discharge diagnosis data by 3-Digit Zip code. Uses CSV files generated from the big yearly inpatient SPARCS tables on health.data.ny.gov

2. Zoommable/Choropleth NY State Map, with JSON input. This creates a zoom-able D3 map 5-digit zip code map, with a layer for adding hospital locations and associated data, like number of beds.

3. Google Maps Zip Code Overlay (modified from http://www.caudillweb.com/temp/d3_choropleth.html)). Shows how to overlay D3 on google maps. Performance suffers when there are a lot of individual features to draw, like the zip codes of NY.
